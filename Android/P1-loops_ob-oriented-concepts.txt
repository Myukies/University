1. Create Kotlin class/file in same folder as MainActivity.kt

FILE_ONE.kt (loops)

fun main() {
    // Example of if-else control structure
    val num = 10
    if (num > 0) {
        println("Number is positive")
    } else if (num < 0) {
        println("Number is negative")
    } else {
        println("Number is zero")
    }

    // Example of when control structure
    val day = "Monday"
    val message = when (day) {
        "Monday" -> "Today is Monday"
        "Tuesday" -> "Today is Tuesday"
        "Wednesday" -> "Today is Wednesday"
        "Thursday" -> "Today is Thursday"
        "Friday" -> "Today is Friday"
        "Saturday" -> "Today is Saturday"
        "Sunday" -> "Today is Sunday"
        else -> "Invalid day"
    }
    println(message)

    // Example of loop
    println("Loop Example:")
    for (i in 1..5) {
        println(i)
    }

    // Example of while loop
    println("While Loop Example:")
    var i = 0
    while (i < 5) {
        println(i)
        i++
    }

    // Example of do-while loop
    println("Do-While Loop Example:")
    var j = 0
    do {
        println(j)
        j++
    } while (j < 5)
}



FILE_TWO.kt (Object_Oriented Concepts)

package com.batch_1.practice_1

// Car.kt
class Car(val brand: String, var speed: Int) {
    // Method to increase the speed of the car
    fun accelerate(acceleration: Int) {
        speed += acceleration
        println("$brand is now running at $speed km/h")
    }

    // Method to decrease the speed of the car
    fun decelerate(deceleration: Int) {
        speed -= deceleration
        println("$brand is now running at $speed km/h")
    }
}

fun main() {
    // Create instances of Car class
    val car1 = Car("Toyota", 50)
    val car2 = Car("Honda", 60)

    // Call methods on car instances
    car1.accelerate(20)
    car2.decelerate(10)
}
