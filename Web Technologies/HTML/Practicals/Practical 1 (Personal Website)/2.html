    <h1>Friends</h1>
    <p>
      I used to have a lot of friends growing up, almost everyone in my class knew me and I could probably consider them my friend. But I think most of those friendships were just surface level, we just knew each other because we were in same class and needed each others help from time to time in case we missed a school day. So that's why, out of all those people, I only consider two my actual friends, because our friendship continued even outside of the classroom. Their names are Pratyush and Atharva. We have been together for so many years that I don't even know how our friendship started. We almost do everything together, we go out together, watch movies together, go on long car drives together and etc. Everything seems really fun with these people and I'm gratelful to have such friends. They always have my back no matter what and I can always count on them in any situation.
