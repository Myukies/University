  <h1>About me and people who have made a difference in my life</h1>
  <p>
    There have been numerous people who have had a major impact on my life, if I started counting them all then the list will be quite long. But a few key people who had the most impact on me are my parents, they have taught me every life lesson that I know now. Throughout my life I have made a lot of mistakes but they would always do their best to make me understand what I did wrong and how could I be better. This attitude has greatly helped me in my life, I am constantly learning new things from them even now after all these years. I cannot thank them enough for whatever things they have done for me!
