  <h1>My Dreams and Aspirations</h1>

    <p>I believe everyone as a child is some kind of a dreamer. Maybe their dreams are a little different, some have grand dreams while some have tiny dreams, but I think that's fine as long as one always seeks their dreams. And like that, I too have a few dreams of my own. I am not a very big dreamer, maybe people will call my dream boring but I think it is a nice dream. I don't dream of anything big like getting rich and famous, my dream is more laid back because I just want to have a nice and peaceful life. As long as I can live a relatively stress-free life with plenty of time to engage in my hobbies, I can say I have achieved my dream.<br> As or my aspirations, I have always aspired to be good at whatever I do. I don't really have to be the best, but if I can do a thing nicely and if I'm satisfied with it, then I'm happy.</p>
