    <h1>Unforgettable moments in my life</h1>
    <p>As life goes on, there are uncountable events that take place everyday. Some have big impact while some are miniscule and you barely even notice it. For me, there have been several moments that I can never forget, both good and bad. But one event that stands on the top is the day I got my 10th results. It was the day when I recieved news that one of my close friend had met with an accident and passed away.<br><br>I still remember the day vividly, in the morning everything was joyous because I had just gotten my results, but by the evening everything kind of changed. Almost all of the classmates were shocked and in disbelief including me. We all gathered at the funeral, all the classmates and teachers were there, everyone was sobbing and heart broken. It's one of those days where you are reminded of how fragile life is, experiencing all these things all at once was hard and I don't think I can ever forget such a thing. </p>
